# Alert-Me-Stock

A python script that automates and inform me which stocks I should consider reviewing based on Bollinger Bands

This can increase my productivity and rentability because I don't want to spend time for each stock I have in my wallet, so knowing which ones are overbought, avoiding'em, knowing which ones are oversold and preferably buying them can demenish the time I spent thinking about it and increase accuracy also.
